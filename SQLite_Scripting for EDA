Q1
For every situation where student A likes student B, but student B likes a different student C, return the names and grades of A, B, and C.

SELECT H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade, H3.name, H3.grade
FROM Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2, Highschooler H3, Likes L1, Likes L2
Where L1.ID2 = L2.ID1 AND L2.ID2 != L1.ID1 AND L1.ID1 = H1.ID AND L2.ID1 = H2.ID AND L2.ID2 = H3.ID;

Q2
Find those students for whom all of their friends are in different grades from themselves. Return the students' names and grades.

SELECT name, grade
FROM Highschooler
WHERE Highschooler.ID NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT Highschooler1.ID FROM Friend LEFT JOIN Highschooler Highschooler1 ON Friend.ID1 = Highschooler1.ID LEFT JOIN Highschooler Highschooler2 ON friend.ID2 = Highschooler2.ID Where Highschooler1.grade = Highschooler2.grade);

Q3
What is the average number of friends per student? (Your result should be just one number.)

SELECT AVG(friendcount)
FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) friendcount
FROM Friend
GROUP BY ID1);

Q4
Find the number of students who are either friends with Cassandra or are friends of friends of Cassandra. Do not count Cassandra, even though technically she is a friend of a friend.

SELECT COUNT(distinct Cassandra.ID2) + COUNT(distinct F2.ID2)
FROM 
(SELECT *
FROM Highschooler
LEFT JOIN Friend F1 ON Highschooler.ID = F1.ID1
WHERE name = 'Cassandra') AS Cassandra
LEFT JOIN Friend F2 ON Cassandra.ID2 = F2.ID1
WHERE F2.ID2 != Cassandra.ID1 AND F2.ID2 NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT ID1
                                                 FROM Highschooler
                                                 LEFT JOIN Friend F1 ON Highschooler.ID = F1.ID1
                                                 WHERE name = 'Cassandra');

Q5
Find the name and grade of the student(s) with the greatest number of friends.

SELECT name, grade
FROM Highschooler
LEFT JOIN (SELECT ID, COUNT(ID2) AS frdnum
FROM Highschooler H1
LEFT JOIN Friend F1 ON F1.ID1 = H1.ID
GROUP BY ID) USING (ID)
WHERE frdnum = (SELECT COUNT(ID2) AS max
FROM Highschooler H1
LEFT JOIN Friend F1 ON F1.ID1 = H1.ID
GROUP BY ID
ORDER BY max DESC
LIMIT 1);
